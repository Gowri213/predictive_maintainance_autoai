# Predictive_maintenance_model
Project using IBM AutoAI to build a predictive maintenance model

## ðŸ›  Problem Statement

Industrial machinery is often subject to sudden failures, leading to high repair costs, production delays, and unplanned downtime. Traditional maintenance strategies like reactive or time-based maintenance are inefficient in preventing such issues. There is a growing need for intelligent systems that can predict machine failures in advance using data-driven techniques.

## âœ… Proposed Solution

This project presents a Predictive Maintenance system built using IBM AutoAI on IBM Cloud. The AutoAI tool automates the machine learning pipeline, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. By training models on sensor and operational data, the system can accurately predict potential equipment failures. The final model can be deployed to help industries:

Detect anomalies early

Schedule maintenance only when needed

Minimize downtime and repair costs

Extend the lifespan of critical assets

Improve operational reliability and safety

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements

Real-Time Data Integration: Connect the model with IoT sensors for live data streaming and real-time failure prediction.

Custom Feature Engineering: Incorporate domain-specific features (e.g., vibration frequency, temperature trends) to enhance model accuracy.

Model Explainability: Use tools like SHAP or LIME to provide explainable AI insights for better trust and transparency.

Multi-Class Classification: Extend the model to predict specific types of failures rather than a simple failure/no-failure output.

Scheduled Retraining: Automate periodic retraining of the model using fresh data to maintain accuracy over time.

User Interface Dashboard: Build a front-end dashboard to visualize predictions, trends, and machine health status.

Alert System: Integrate email/SMS alert system to notify maintenance teams in case of high failure probability.
